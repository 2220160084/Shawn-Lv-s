About Dr. Lv's subjects
We design VRE to fulfill feature selection on dataset with high-dimensionality and minor-dataset characteristics, such as fmri dataset.
Then we manipulate a simulation dataset with a shape of 60 rows and 3000 columns (60 arrays with 3000 elements made up for each). And 50 arrays are divided as training dataset, another 10 arrays are divided as test dataset.
Among the 3000 elements, there are 6 features with the most significance, 2 features with great significance and 2 features with significance to classify the dataset into 3 categorise.
For explicit details, please refer to Dataset_Maker.ipynb.
Here, we provide the dependent software information as follows.
python 3.6.4
numpy 1.16.0
matplotlib 2.2.2
